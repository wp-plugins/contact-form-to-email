The main purpose of the **Contact Form to Email** is, as the name indicates, to **create contact forms** and **send their data email addresses**.

In addition to that basic feature it also **saves the form data into a database**, provides **printable reports** and the option to **export selected data to CSV/Excel** files.

= More about the Main Features: =

* **Email delivery / notifications:** The contact form data is sent by email to one or more email addresses. It also supports the configuration of auto-replies to the user who filled the form.
* **Form data saved into the database:** Avoid losing submissions and keep a record of the received contact form messages.
* **Printable list of messages:** Get the list of contacts received within a selected date range and print it.
* **Export data to CSV/Excel:** Export the contact form data to a standard format that can be used by other applications. Export the email addresses and other form data using date and text search filters.
* **Automatic reports:** Provide automatic reports of the form usage and data entered into the form. Report of daily submissions and accumulative hourly report. Printable reports for specific fields into the form. Helps you top understand your data.
* **Form Validation:** Set validation rules for each field. Keep your data clean.
* **Anti-spam protection:** Built-it captcha anti-spam protection. No need to rely on external services for the anti-spam protection.
* **Customizable email messages:** Specify the text of the email notifications. Supports both plain text emails and HTML formatted emails.

= Messages List =

The messages list helps to check the past submissions and print or export them. Includes a search/filter form with the following options:

* **Search for:** Search for a text into the contact form messages.
* **From ... to:** Date interval to be included in the list/reports.
* **Item:** You can have more than one form. Select here if you want to get the results of a specific form or from all forms.
* **Filter:** Shows the list according to the selected filters/options.
* **Export to CSV:** Export the CSV date according to the selected filters/options.

The CSV file will contain a first row with the field names and the next rows will contain one submission per row, with one for field on each column. This way you can easily import the data from other applications or just select the columns/fields that you need (example: select only the emails). A CSV file can be opened and managed using Excel.

The list of messages is shown below the search area. A print button below the list provides the messages list in a printable format.

= The Reports =

The reports section lets you **analyze the use of the contact forms** and the data entered into them. The first section of the reports is a filter section similar to the one that appears in the messages list page. Below the filters section there are three graphical reports:

* **Submissions per day:** The report will display in a point-lines graphic how many contact form submissions have been received each day in the selected date range. This report can be used to evaluate the contact peaks and measure the impact of marketing actions.

* **Submissions per hour:** The report will display in a point-lines graphic how many messages are received on each hour of the date; this is for the total messages in the selected date range. This report can be used for checking peak hours and focus the support service on those hours.

* **Report of values for a selected field:** Select any of the contact form fields and other information fields (like date, ip, hours) to get a report of how many times each value have been entered or selected. This is very useful if you form is used as a poll to get feedback from users, it makes easy to generate a report on selectable fields. This report can be used also to study the most common data entered in the form and get a better idea of your customer's profile and needs.

A print button at the end of the page can be used to print the report of the values for the selected field in a printer-friendly format.
